		<p ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"> Python</a> is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>

		<p>Python is <strong>dynamically typed and garbage-collected</strong>. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>

				<p class="para">A microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.” Includes a built-in development server, unit tesing support, and is fully Unicode-enabled with RESTful request dispatching and WSGI compliance.</p>

		<h2 id="field"><strong>Popular Fields Using Python =></strong></h2>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Web Development -</strong></li>
				<br>
				<img src="webdev.jpg" alt="web development" width="40%">
			
				<p class="para">Python can be used to make web-applications at a rapid rate. Why is that? It is because of the frameworks Python uses to create these applications. There is common-backend logic that goes into making these frameworks and a number of libraries that can help integrate protocols such as HTTPS, FTP, SSL etc. and even help in the processing of JSON, XML, E-Mail and so much more.</p>	

			<li><strong>Game Development -</strong></li>
				<br>
				<img src="pygame.jpg" alt="Pygame" width="40%">
			
				<p class="para">Python is also used in the development of interactive games. There are libraries such as PySoy which is a 3D game engine supporting Python 3, PyGame which provides functionality and a library for game development. Games such as Civilization-IV, Disney’s Toontown Online, Vega Strike etc. have been built using Python.</p>

			<li><strong>Machine Learning & Artificial 	Intelligence -</strong></li>
			<br>
				<img src="ai.png" alt="Machine learning.png" width="40%">
			
				<p class="para">Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are the talks of the town as they yield the most promising careers for the future. We make the computer learn based on past experiences through the data stored or better yet, create algorithms which makes the computer learn by itself. </p>

			<li><strong>Data Science -</strong></li>
			<br>

				<img src="dsc.png" alt="data science.png" width="40%">

				<p class="para">Data is money if you know how to extract relevant information which can help you take calculated risks and increase profits. You study the data you have, perform operations and extract the information required. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy help you in extracting information.</p>

			<li><strong>Desktop Gui -</strong></li>
			<br>

				<img src="deskgui.png" alt="Desktop Gui.png" width="40%">

				<p class="para">We use Python to program desktop applications. It provides the Tkinter library that can be used to develop user interfaces. There are some other useful toolkits such as the wxWidgets, Kivy, PYQT that can be used to create applications on several platforms.You can start out with creating simple applications such as Calculators, To-Do apps and go ahead and create much more complicated applications.</p>
